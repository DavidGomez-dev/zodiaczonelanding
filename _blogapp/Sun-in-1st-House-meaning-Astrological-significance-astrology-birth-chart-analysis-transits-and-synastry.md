In the realm of astrology, the Sun symbolizes our core essence, the driving force that fuels our will to exist, and the quest for purpose. The 1st House, also known as the Ascendant, represents our outer self, the mask we wear for the world, and our approach to new beginnings and initiatives.

Within the deeper layers of **astrological birth chart analysis**, the 1st House can be seen as the foundation upon which the self is built.
