Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. Use pillows and blankets to support your body. Ensure your spine is straight but relaxed.

### Step 3: Ground Yourself

Close your eyes and take a few deep, slow breaths. Imagine roots growing from the base of your spine or your feet, delving deep into the earth. Feel the stability and support from the ground.
