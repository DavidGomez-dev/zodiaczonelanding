# Harness a Fresh Start: Join our New Moon Guided Meditation for Intuition

When the New Moon graces the sky, it marks the perfect moment to turn inward and set the foundations for new beginnings. This phase of the lunar cycle is about reflection, intention-setting, and tapping into your inner guidance. Our New Moon guided meditation session offers an opportunity to harness the energy of the New Moon to cultivate clarity, focus, and intuition.

During the New Moon, when the night is at its darkest, it's the optimal time to delve into the depths of your subconscious and find the answers that often elude us during the daylight hours.
